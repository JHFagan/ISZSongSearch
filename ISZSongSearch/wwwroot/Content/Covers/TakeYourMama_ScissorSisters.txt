Original recorded version is in Bb. For this version, capo up 3 frets (you can hear
the high Bb note on the high E string, made by using a G formation on the 6th fret).
They probably actually play it in "B" tuned down 1/2 step, but this is an easy way to
do the Am descending bass pattern.
 
All chords are choked off with the heel of your pick hand for the choppy rhythm feel

[Verse]
 
         G                              F
When you grow up livin' like a good boy oughta
         Am                              G
And your mama takes a shine to her best son
          G                                    F
Something different all the girls they seem to like you
             Am                                        G
Cause you're handsome like to talk and a whole lot of fun
 
             Am             Am/G
But now your girl's gone a missin'
         Am/F#            D     G
And your house has got an empty bed
             Am               Am/G
The folks'll wonder 'bout the wedding
           A/F#        D        G
They won't listen to a word you said
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G
Gonna take your mama out all night
            F
Yeah we'll show her what it's all about
               C
We'll get her jacked up on some cheap champagne
              G
We'll let the good times all roll out
           G
And if the music ain't good, well it's just too bad
             F
We're gonna sing along no matter what
            C
Because the dancers don't mind at the New Orleans
            G                      F F F# G
If you tip 'em and they make a cut

It's a struggle livin' like a good boy oughta
       Am                                  G
In the summer watchin' all the girls pass by
          G                                  F
When your mama heard the way that you'd been talking
                Am                             G
I tried to tell you that all she'd wanna do is cry
 
 
[Verse]
 
       Am                     Am/G
Now we end up takin' the long way home
Am/F#                         D                G
Lookin' overdressed wearin' buckets of stale cologne
        Am                        Am/G
It's so hard to see streets on a country road
          Am/F#
When your glasses in the garbage
         D                      G
And your Continental's just got towed
 
 
[Chorus]
 
      G
