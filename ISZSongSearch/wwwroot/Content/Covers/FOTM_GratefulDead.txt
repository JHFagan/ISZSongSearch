Fire On The Mountain - The Grateful Dead

[Verse 1]
B                               A
Long distance runner, what you standin' there for?
B                              A
Get up, get out,          get out of the door
B                                 A
You're playin' cold music on the barroom floor
B                             A
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core.
B                                    A
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
B                                   A
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down.
 
[Hook]
B                 A
Fire! fire on the mountain!
 
[Verse 2]
B                       A
Almost ablaze still you don't feel the heat
B                            A
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat.
B                                  A
You say it's a livin', we all gotta eat
B                                 A
But you're here alone, there's no one to compete.
B                        A
If mercy's a business, I wish it for you
B                              A
More than just ashes when your dreams come true.
 
[Hook]
B                 A
Fire! fire on the mountain!
 
[Verse 3]
B                              A
Long distance runner, what you holdin' out for?
B                          A
Caught in slow motion in a dash for the door.
B                                 A
The flame from your stage has now spread to the floor
B                             A
You gave all you had. why you wanna give more?
B                           A
The more that you give, the more it will take
B                                 A
To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake.
 
[Hook]
B                 A
Fire! fire on the mountain!
