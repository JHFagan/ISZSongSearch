[Verse 1]
E
I ain't got no back porch
F#m
I ain't got a rocking chair
A
I got a dirty old coat I got shaky hands
      G           A       E
And a face like a grizzly bear
E
I'm an old wino and I scare all the ladies
F#m
Yeah you might say that I'm a bum
A
But I'm sure wired up to the Honky Red
      G           A       E
And that good Gold Anchor rum
 
[Chorus]
Bm                      A
When I need a drink I'm stains on a sink
G              A         E
I'm please and thank you ma'am
Bm                      A
But when I got a head full of Honky Red
 G              A         E
I don't give no good goddamn
 
[Verse 2]
E
I fought in your wars now I sleep in your doors
F#m
An' I left my leg in France
A
All that remains is a ghostly pain
         G        E       A
When the mornings get too damp
E
I come from the styx I got grade six
F#m
And I ain't much in demand.
A
I deliver hand bills and I steal red pills
         G           A          E
From the boys in the whorehouse band
 
[Chorus]
Bm                      A
When I need a drink I'm stains on a sink
G              A         E
I'm please and thank you ma'am
Bm                      A
But when I got a head full of Honky Red
 G              A         E
I don't give no good goddamn
 
[Verse 3]
E
I've got me a little girl that I see sometimes
F#m
She's damn near half a ton
A
In a furnished room in the Joyceville pen
  G        A       E
I got me a no good son
E
But I'll keep me a head full of Honky Red
F#m
'til the reaper tolls the bell
A
If I'm as high when I die as I was when I lived
           G         A       E
I'll be in heaven as sure as hell
 
[Chorus]
Bm                      A
When I need a drink I'm stains on a sink
G              A         E
I'm please and thank you ma'am
Bm                      A
But when I got a head full of Honky Red
 G              A         E
I don't give no good goddamn
 
[Chorus]
Bm                      A
When I need a drink I'm stains on a sink
G              A         E
I'm please and thank you ma'am
 
Bm                      A
But when I got a head full of Honky Red
 G              A         E
I don't give no good goddamn
