[Verse 1]
        Em
He came dancing across the water
           D
With his galleons and guns
Am7
Looking for the new world
                       Am7*
In that palace in the sun
 
[Verse 2]
        Em
On the shore lay Montezuma
          D
With his coca leaves and pearls
Am7
In his halls he often wandered
                         Am7*
With the secrets of the worlds.
 
[Verse 3]
         Em
And his subjects gathered 'round him
           D
Like the leaves around a tree
           Am7
In their clothes of many colours
                      Am7*
For the angry gods to see.
 
[Verse 4]
          Em
And the women all were beautiful
         D
And the men stood straight and strong
       Am7
They offered life in sacrifice
                        Am7*
So that others could go on.
 
(Solo)
 
[Verse 5]
    Em
Hate was just a legend
    D
And war was never known
    Am7
The people worked together
                        Am7*
And they lifted many stones
 
[Verse 6]
      Em
They carried them to the flatlands
         D
And they died along the way
         Am7
But they built up with their bare hands
                         Am7*
What we still can't do today.
 
[Verse 7]
      Em
And I know she's living there
        D
And she loves me to this day
Am7
I still can't remember when
                 Am7*
Or how I lost my way.
 
(Solo)

       Em
He came dancing across the water
D
Cortez, Cortez
Am7           Am7*      Em
What a killer.
