Joe Cocker
 
[Intro]
 
G     D     A     G     D     A
G     D     A     G     D     A
 
 
[Verse]
 
A              E        Bm
What would you do if I sang out of tune
           E                       A
Would you stand up and walk out on me
              E             Bm
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
E                                A
And I'll try not to sing out of key
 
 
[Chorus]
 
          G                 D             A
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
           G                  D             A
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
           G                 D             A
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
G     D   A
Oooo ooo ooo
 
 
[Verse]
 
A         E           Bm
What do I do when my love is away
          E                A
(Does it worry you to be alone?)
          E          Bm
How do I feel by the end of the day
          E                          A
(Are you sad because you're on your own?)
 
 
[Chorus]
 
          G                 D             A

[Verse]
 
A           E           Bm
Would you believe in a love at first sight
         E                                A
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
             E            Bm
What do you see when you turn out the light
E
I can't tell you but I know it's mine
