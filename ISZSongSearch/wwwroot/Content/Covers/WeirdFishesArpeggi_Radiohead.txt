[Verse 1]
Em7
In the deepest ocean
     F#m7
The bottom of the sea
     A  A7  A6
Your eyes
     Gmaj7
They turn me
 
Em7
Why should I stay here?
F#m7                    A  A7  A6   Gmaj7
Why should I stay?
 
Em7
I'd be crazy not to follow
     F#m7
Follow where you lead
     A  A7  A6
Your eyes
     Gmaj7
They turn me
 
Em7
Turn me on to phantoms
     F#m7
I follow to the edge
     A  A7  A6
Of the earth
     Gmaj7
And fall off
 
Em7
Everybody leaves
     F#m7
If they get the chance
    A  A7  A6  Gmaj7
And this is my chance
 
 
[Part 2]
A6
I get eaten by the worms
      Gmaj7
Weird fishes
A6
Picked over by the worms
      Gmaj7
Weird fishes
      A6
Weird fishes
       Gmaj7
Weird fishes

Hit the bottom and escape
   Gmaj7
Escape
 
Bm           C
I'll hit the bottom

Hit the bottom and escape
