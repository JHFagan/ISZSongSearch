[Verse] 1
 
          Em          G              C           G
Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly last night 
Em       G                 C   G
and they blew up his house too
Em          G                  C           G
Down on the boardwalk, they're ready for a fight 
      Em            G               D
gonna see what them racket boys can do
 
 
Em                  G               C     G
Now there's trouble busing in, from outta state
        Em         G        C   G
and the D.A. can't get no relief
Em       G                  C     G
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade 
        Em                G                       D
and the gambling commissioners hanging on, by the skin of his teeth
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em         G         C        G
Everything dies baby that's a fact
    Em               G             C         G
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
         Em     G            C       G
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty and
Em        G           C      G
Meet me tonight, in Atlantic City

[Verse 2]
 
       Em            G               C      G
Well I got a job and tried to put my money away
      Em              G       C                G
But I got the kind of debt no honest man could pay
     Em          G            C       G
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
      Em            G               D
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em         G         C        G
Everything dies baby that's a fact
    Em               G             C         G
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
         Em     G            C       G
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty and
Em        G           C      G
Meet me tonight, in Atlantic City

[Bridge]
 
        C                           Em
Now our luck may have died, and our love may be cold 
         C       D         Em
but with you, forever I'll stay
           C                    Em
Yeah we're going out where, the sand turns to gold
D
so put your stockings on, cause it might get cold
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em         G         C        G
Everything dies baby that's a fact
    Em               G             C         G
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
         Em     G            C       G
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty and
Em        G           C      G
Meet me tonight, in Atlantic City

[Verse 3]
 
           Em            G            C       G
Now I been looking for a job but it's hard to find
        Em                  G              C             G
There's winners and there's losers and I'm south of that line
         Em              G          C      G
Well I'm tired of coming out on the losing end
      Em                   G                       D
But I talked to a man last night gonna do a little favor for him
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em         G         C        G
Everything dies baby that's a fact
    Em               G             C         G
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
         Em     G            C       G
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty and
Em        G           C      G
Meet me tonight, in Atlantic City
